EFFECTS OF POVERTY:</P></b>

font-family:Times New Roman;
font-size:15px;">
1.Limited Access to Basic Needs: Poverty deprives individuals and families of access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, and education, compromising their overall well-being.

2.Health Disparities: Poverty is closely linked to poor health outcomes. Lack of access to healthcare services, proper nutrition, and sanitation can lead to higher rates of malnutrition, disease, and reduced life expectancy.

3.Education Barriers: Poverty often limits access to quality education, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage. Children from impoverished backgrounds may face barriers such as lack of resources, inadequate school facilities, and the need to work instead of attending school.

4.Social Exclusion: Poverty can result in social exclusion and limited participation in societal activities, reinforcing feelings of marginalization and isolation.

5.Inter-generational Poverty: Poverty can be passed down through generations, as limited opportunities and resources prevent individuals from breaking free from the cycle of poverty. Children growing up in poverty are more likely to experience poverty as adults.
