CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE:</b>

font-size:15px;">
1.Greenhouse Gas Emissions: The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy production, industrial processes, transportation, and deforestation releases greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to the greenhouse effect and the subsequent warming of the planet.

2.Deforestation: The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and urbanization reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, contributing to higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

3.Agriculture and Livestock: Agricultural activities, including the use of synthetic fertilizers, enteric fermentation in livestock, and rice cultivation, generate methane and nitrous oxide emissions, which are potent greenhouse gases.

4.Industrial Processes: Certain industrial processes, such as cement production and chemical manufacturing, emit greenhouse gases during their operations.

EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE:</P></b>
<p>

font-family:Times New Roman;
font-size:15px;">
1.Rising Temperatures: Global temperatures have been steadily increasing, resulting in heatwaves and heat-related illnesses. Warmer temperatures also lead to the melting of glaciers and ice caps, contributing to rising sea levels.
</P><p>

2.Changes in Precipitation Patterns: Climate change can alter rainfall patterns, resulting in more frequent and intense droughts, floods, and storms. These changes can disrupt agriculture, water supplies, and ecosystems.

</P><p>
 <span style=

font-family:Times New Roman;
font-size:15px;">
3.Sea-Level Rise: As temperatures rise, glaciers and polar ice caps melt, causing sea levels to rise. This leads to coastal erosion, increased flooding, and the loss of low-lying areas and habitats.
</P><p>

font-family:Times New Roman;

4.Altered Ecosystems: Climate change affects ecosystems and biodiversity. Some species may face habitat loss or shifts in migration patterns, while others may struggle to adapt to changing conditions, leading to reduced biodiversity and ecosystem disruption.
</P><p>
 <span style=

5.Water Scarcity: Changes in precipitation patterns can result in water scarcity in certain regions. Increased evaporation rates and higher temperatures can also contribute to water loss from lakes, rivers, and reservoirs.
</P><p>

font-family:Times New Roman;

6.Impacts on Human Health: Climate change can have adverse effects on human health. Heatwaves can cause heatstroke and exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Changes in the distribution of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue fever) can also occur.
